# Usage

This guide runs sessions on a machine set up with [Setup](SETUP.md). A session is one
agent learning one task: it explores, writes a robot program, and is then evaluated on
the task's official test episodes. Each session owns its simulators, MCP service, agent
container and storage, so several sessions run in parallel on one or more GPUs without
sharing state.

Every action has a terminal command; the [dashboard](../services/dashboard/README.md)
is a front end to the same commands.

| Step | Dashboard | Terminal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Prepare | **New session** → **Prepare** | `runtime/envs/host/bin/python scripts/configure_auto_research.py ...` |
| Launch | **Launch** (headless) | `bash scripts/start_auto_research_agent.sh --config <session>/operator-input.json` |
| Stop | **Stop** | `bash scripts/stop_auto_research_agent.sh --config <session>/operator-input.json` |
| Resume | **Resume** (headless) | `bash scripts/start_auto_research_agent.sh --config <session>/operator-input.json --resume` |
| Move to another GPU | - | `bash scripts/move_session_gpus.sh --config <session>/operator-input.json --sim-gpu <index or UUID>` |

Sessions live in `runtime/auto-research/<session-id>/`, where the ID is the creation
time and a random suffix, for example `20261013T120000Z_1a2b3c4d5e`.

## 1. Prepare a session

Preparing writes `<session>/operator-input.json` and starts nothing: no model call and
no simulator. It checks the task's layouts, pins the agent image by digest, maps the GPU
to its UUID, and checks that the expert episodes the session will mount are installed.

```bash
runtime/envs/host/bin/python scripts/configure_auto_research.py \
    --task opendoor --sim-gpu 0 --episodes 16
```

It prints the configuration path and the launch command. A configuration is used once:
to change a setting, prepare a new session.

### Tasks

The seven HumanoidArena tasks with official test episodes, with their step limits at 50 Hz:
`opendoor` (1800), `boxing_bag` (900), `pickplace_box` (1450), `doubledesk` (2000),
`sit_sofa` (2000), `football_single` (2000) and `warehouse_navigation` (1800). See
[HumanoidArena backend](HUMANOID_BACKEND.md#tasks-and-layouts).

Some settings are fixed for HumanoidArena (`services/benchmarks.py`). Passing another value
is an error that names the reason, for example
`--formal-eval-seed does not apply to HumanoidArena sessions: ...`.

### Settings

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--task` | required | Task name |
| `--sim-gpu` | required | Simulator GPU index or UUID. Agents have no GPU |
| `--episodes` | 5 | Exploration episodes (1..1000; the dashboard allows 2..1000). Each rehearsal uses one |
| `--exploration-envs` | 1 | Simulator environments the agent can use at once (1..8); see [section 5](#5-parallel-exploration-and-subagents) |
| `--subagents` | 0 | Concurrent subagents (0..8). 0 means one per environment when there are several, none with one |
| `--agent-cli` | `codex` | `codex` or `claude` |
| `--agent-provider` | `openrouter` | Claude Code's model provider: `openrouter`, `claude-login` or `anthropic` ([Setup, step 6](SETUP.md#6-agent-cli-and-model-credentials)). Codex uses its provider profile instead |
| `--agent-effort` | `xhigh` | Reasoning effort, `xhigh` or `max`, for the agent and its formal copies |
| `--observation-profile` | `rgbd` | `rgbd`, or `rgb-only` (no depth or camera geometry) |
| `--expert-demonstrations` | 0 | Expert episodes mounted read-only for the exploring agent: 0 or 3 ([Setup, step 7](SETUP.md#7-expert-episodes-optional)) |
| `--expert-content` | `full` | What they hold: `full` (commanded references, measured motion, object states, camera) or `images` (front-camera video, previews and depth only) |
| `--demonstration-context` | `none` | Demonstration images from the expert episodes (they must be installed): `none`, `terminal_state` (their final frames) or `completion_sequence` (ordered previews) |
| `--agent-formal` | `off` | Evaluation mode: `off` (code mode) or `on` (live copies); see [section 4](#4-evaluation) |
| `--formal-episodes` | 60 | Official test episodes to evaluate (1..60) |
| `--formal-workers` | 4 | Formal episodes run at once (1..16) |
| `--formal-seed` | 0 | First official test episode |
| `--exploration-start-seed` | 0 | First exploration layout |
| `--formal-context` | `compact` | Agent formal: the conversation each copy carries, `resume` (whole), `compact` (summarized) or `clear` (none) |
| `--transfer-parts` | `memory,code,handoff` | Agent formal: workspace folders each copy carries |
| `--transfer-mb` | 100 | Cap on the carried folders (1..1024 MB) |
| `--workspace-gib` | 1024 | Size of the session's sparse workspace image; only used blocks take disk |
| `--recording-gib` | 10 | Size of a robot program's RAM-backed output folder and of a submitted bundle |
| `--image` | `rax-auto-research:dev` | Agent image; must be installed locally, never pulled |

Fixed for HumanoidArena: `--formal-eval-seed 1` (the official test episodes) and
`--exploration-collection 0`, `--task-rules public` (TASK.md always states the task and its
success condition), and no adaptation, handoff or episode reviews.

The dashboard form holds the same settings except `--recording-gib` and `--image`, which
keep their defaults there.

## 2. Launch

```bash
bash scripts/start_auto_research_agent.sh --config runtime/auto-research/<session-id>/operator-input.json
```

The launcher builds the session's capped workspace, starts its MCP service and model
relay, and runs the agent CLI in the offline container with the kickoff prompt from the
workspace's `START_PROMPT.md`. Model calls start here and are paid.

- **Interactive (default):** the agent's terminal UI opens in your terminal. The session
  runs until you quit the UI; then the launcher freezes the agent and runs the formal
  evaluation. Closing the terminal stops the session like **Stop** does (a launcher
  started under `nohup` keeps running), so use `tmux` or `screen` for long sessions.
- **Headless:** `--non-interactive` runs the default kickoff without a UI, and
  `--exec-prompt "<text>"` runs your own prompt instead. The dashboard's **Launch** and
  **Resume** run headless, logging to `<session>/agent.log`.

Other launcher flags:

| Flag | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `--profile <name>` | Codex provider profile (default: the name in `<CODEX_HOME>/experiment-profile`, else `openrouter`) |
| `--provider-home <dir>` | Where provider profiles live (default: `$CODEX_HOME`, else `~/.codex`) |
| `--key-file <file>` | OpenRouter key file (default: `~/.codex/secrets/openrouter_api_key` when it exists, else `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`) |
| `--claude-key-file <file>` | Claude `anthropic` provider: an API key file (else `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`). `claude-login`: a token file other than the experiment token |
| `--claude-model <id>` | Claude: override the provider's default model |
| `--prepare-only` | Deploy the workspace and print its paths, then stop without a model call or episode. This uses up the configuration; prepare a new one to run |

Dashboard launches use the defaults of these flags, read in the dashboard's own
environment.

A session runs one launcher at a time; a second launch exits with
`Another launcher is running this session`.

### Remote machines

The dashboard binds only to loopback. Forward its port and open the printed URL locally:

```bash
ssh -L 8765:127.0.0.1:8765 <host>
```

## 3. Monitor, stop and resume

### What a session runs

1. **Explore.** The agent reads `TASK.md` and any expert episodes, then works the robot
   through MCP tools. `start_episode` starts the next layout; `evaluate` checks the task;
   `finish` closes the episode. It keeps notes in `memory/` and code in `code/`.
2. **Compile.** It writes `code/<project>/controller.py:main(ctx)`, a program that
   checks what it observes at each step, and tests it unattended.
3. **Evaluate.** Code mode or live copies ([section 4](#4-evaluation)).

### Dashboard

The dashboard lists each session's stage, exploration used, formal success rate, agent
tokens and Gemini spend, live camera frames, every simulator episode's video, results,
and the agent and MCP logs. See its [README](../services/dashboard/README.md).

### Session files

| Path | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `operator-input.json` | The prepared configuration |
| `configuration.json`, `state.json` | The deployed configuration and the supervisor's state (episodes, bundles, submission, formal batches, Gemini ledger). Both must agree with `operator-input.json` to resume |
| `agent-lifecycle.json` | Launcher status (`preparing`, `running`, `usage_wait`, `formal`, `exited`, `stopped`, `failed`), every earlier attempt, relaunches and agent errors |
| `agent.log`, `frontend.log` | Headless launcher output; the MCP service log, appended per launch |
| `mcp.jsonl` | Every MCP call and its result |
| `model-calls.json`, `model-usage.jsonl` | Model calls over all launches; Claude Code token usage per call (Codex usage is read from `codex-home/`) |
| `provider-errors.jsonl` | Failed Gemini calls with the provider's raw response |
| `agent-workspace/`, `codex-home/` or `claude-home/` | The agent's workspace and CLI home, on the capped image `agent-storage.ext4` |
| `native/results/<run>/sim/` | Each simulator episode's own records and video |
| `exploration/` | The episode ledger of parallel exploration |
| `formal.json` | What ran after exploration: `exploration_incomplete`, `frozen`, `completed` or `failed` with the error |
| `formal-scores.json`, `agent-formal-scores.json` | Formal results per episode and overall ([section 6](#6-results)) |
| `formal-workers/`, `agent-formal/` | One directory per formal episode: logs, and for live copies their transcripts and notes |
| `published/` | Run artifacts the agent could read (frames, traces, reports) |
| `subagents.json` | Subagents spawned, peak concurrency, calls per agent |
| `gpu-moves.jsonl` | GPU moves of this session |

### Stop

**Stop**, or `scripts/stop_auto_research_agent.sh`, sends the session's launcher SIGTERM
(through a pidfd, never to a recycled PID). The launcher stops the agent, its
containers and simulators, and records `stopped`. Budgets are not restored. With one
exploration environment, an episode that was running stays charged; with several,
it is refunded (see [section 5](#5-parallel-exploration-and-subagents)).

### Resume

A stopped, exited, failed or crashed session resumes in its own conversation (Codex
`exec resume`, Claude Code `--resume`) and in the same workspace, remounting its
capped storage if needed (for example after a reboot).

- The agent gets a short prompt to reread `memory/PROGRESS.md` and call `status`;
  `--exec-prompt` replaces it.
- Episodes left live by the previous launcher are recorded as interrupted, leftover
  simulators are stopped, and exploration reopens.
- Model calls keep counting in `model-calls.json`, and the Gemini ledger continues.
- Resuming a session whose exploration has closed restarts no agent: it runs only the
  formal steps that have not run. An interrupted agent formal continues with the episodes
  that have no outcome; an interrupted code-mode formal batch is not rerun.
- Resume is refused while the launcher is alive, for a session that was only prepared,
  and for a first launch that failed before its workspace existed (prepare a new
  session then).

### Move to another GPU

Stop the session first, then:

```bash
bash scripts/move_session_gpus.sh --config <session>/operator-input.json --sim-gpu 1
```

It refuses while any process still uses the session, rewrites the simulator GPU in all
three saved copies, moves agent-formal copies listed on the old GPU, and logs the move to
`gpu-moves.jsonl`. Resume afterwards. Any other change to a launched configuration
prevents resuming.

### Automatic relaunch

In a headless session, the launcher continues the agent's conversation while
exploration is open:

- **Turn ended:** the agent is prompted to continue, at most 3 times per launch.
- **Run failed** (provider overload, broken stream): it continues after 300 s, up to
  5 failures in a row. A run of 30 minutes or more resets the count.
- **Claude `claude-login` usage limit:** the session waits for the window's reset with
  its episodes up (lifecycle `usage_wait`, `usage_limited_until`), then continues, up to
  10 waits per launch.

An interactive session is never relaunched.

## 4. Evaluation

Each session has one evaluation mode, set when it is prepared.

### Code mode (`--agent-formal off`, default)

1. **Register** freezes `code/<project>/` as a bundle without running it.
2. **Rehearse** runs the whole bundle in a fresh exploration episode under formal
   limits, unattended. It uses one exploration episode. A clean rehearsal ran to its end
   without an error, timeout or simulator exit; the task need not succeed.
3. **Submit** takes one cleanly rehearsed bundle and closes exploration. It returns no
   score.

When the agent has ended, the launcher freezes the session (memory, code, handoff and
the conversation) and runs the formal batch: `--formal-episodes` official test episodes,
each in a fresh container and simulator, `--formal-workers` at a time, with no agent,
edits or retries. Programs get 4 CPUs and 8 GiB of memory, and no network or GPU.

Episode limits: an episode ends at task success, at the task's step limit, or when the
robot falls; its wall-clock limit is 600 s of startup plus 1 s per control step.

### Live copies (`--agent-formal on`)

Exploration has no `register`, `rehearse` or `submit`; the agent is told to practice:
solve the task, build a controller, and use every episode to test it. Exploration closes
when no episode remains and none is live.

After exploration, one copy of the agent plays each official test episode:

- Each copy gets a fresh capped workspace with `FORMAL_AGENTS.md` as its `AGENTS.md`,
  `TASK.md`, the robot skills, the carried folders and its conversation
  (`--formal-context`: `compact` runs one forced compaction first).
- Carried folders are packed in the order `handoff`, `memory`, `code`; a folder that
  does not fit in the remaining `--transfer-mb` is left out whole, and later ones may
  still fit. `state.json` records what was carried.
- Copies have robot tools, Gemini and Python on their one environment, but no lifecycle
  tools. They start 60 s apart, `--formal-workers` at a time. A copy whose run fails
  continues after 300 s, up to 5 failures in a row.
- The episode limit is the task's formal limit, with 120 s to wrap up after the episode
  ends.

To spread copies over several GPUs, add `"formal_sim_gpus": ["GPU-...", "GPU-..."]`
(UUIDs) to `operator-input.json` before the first launch. Copy *i* uses entry
*i* modulo the list length.

### More evaluations of a finished session

- **Live copies after code mode:** play a finished code-mode session's test episodes
  with copies of its frozen agent, beside its bundle formal:

  ```bash
  bash scripts/start_auto_research_agent.sh --config <session>/operator-input.json --resume --agent-formal
  ```

  It needs closed exploration.
- **Re-evaluate a rehearsed bundle** on more episodes, without a model:

  ```bash
  PYTHONPATH=. runtime/envs/host/bin/python -m services.controller.parallel_batch \
      --source-session <session> --bundle <bundle-id> \
      --output runtime/auto-research/<new-directory> --episodes 60 --workers 4
  ```

  The bundle must have a clean rehearsal; the source session is not changed.

## 5. Parallel exploration and subagents

With `--exploration-envs N` (2..8) the agent has N simulator environments at once, each
its own Isaac Sim process, started on first use.

- Robot and episode tools take `env_id`; calls to different environments run
  concurrently, and calls to one environment run in order.
- All environments share one episode budget: every start, reset and rehearsal uses one.
- An episode that never ran to its own end (the session stopped, or its environment's
  process failed) is not charged, and its layout is played again next. The agent is told.
  With one environment, every start is charged.
- Rehearsals and formal episodes always use one environment.

`--subagents N` caps concurrent subagents. With one environment and N subagents, the
subagents take turns on the environment. Codex enforces the cap; Claude Code is told it
and is measured. `subagents.json` records spawns, peak concurrency and calls per agent.

Memory grows with live environments; see [GPU memory](SETUP.md#gpu-memory).

## 6. Results

Results are operator-only; the agent never sees formal results.

- **Per episode:** success or failure by the task's success condition. There is no
  partial credit: an episode that falls, errors or stops short of the condition fails.
- **Success rate:** successes over the scheduled episodes. Success needs task success and
  a clean run; other episodes are `unsuccessful` or `error`.

Code-mode results: `published/formal_batch.json` and `formal-scores.json`. Live copies:
`published/agent_formal_batch.json` and `agent-formal-scores.json`.

## 7. Gemini

The agent can call `gemini_generate` (`google/gemini-3.8-flash` on OpenRouter), for
example to check an image. Each session has one $10 budget, shared by exploration,
rehearsals, formal episodes and live copies; the dashboard shows the spend. Without an
OpenRouter key every call answers `Gemini is not configured`.
